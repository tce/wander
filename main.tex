\section{Introduction}

Query loop:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe: create the query
\itme Query: run the query and get results
\item Eval: evaluate query resutls to detemrine if query is resolved or if query needs to be refined to obtain the desired information. 
\end{enumeate}

Three types of search:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Purposeful: Directed search or querying where a complete description of what is wanted is known and used as a query
\item Exploratory: Semi-directed search where an incomplete description of what is wanted is known and used to start and iterative process of query and query refinement
\item Wandering: Undirected search where no or minimal information is known and must be built up through iterative query and query refinement
\end{enumerate}
